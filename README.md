- 👋 Hi, I’m @FreyFalling
- 👀 I’m interested in learning not just about coding, but the entire process of moving and integrating data i.e. data engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Engeineering basics, Python 3, HTML, and some web development. Also interested in mobile development too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as of yet, still just learning and getting my feet on the ground.
- 📫 How to reach me: through github, and through email if the need arises.
